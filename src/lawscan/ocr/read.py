"""PDF in, Thai text out.

Two routes, chosen per page rather than per document. Real Gazette PDFs are
mixed: the first pages carry a text layer and a scanned annexe does not, and
picking one route for the whole file either loses the annexe or re-recognises
pages that were already perfect.

Everything here is deterministic. No model is called, and the same PDF produces
the same text every time — which is what makes the rules downstream testable.

#: The two ways to read a document.
#:
#: ``text`` recognises only pages that have no text layer at all. It is the
#: cheap one and it is right for the ordinary Gazette PDF, where every page is
#: real text and recognising it again would be slower and worse.
#:
#: ``image`` also reads the pictures. A map annexe, a government form, a
#: diagram with its dimensions written inside it — these are pages whose
#: content is drawn rather than typed, and the text route returns nothing for
#: them however carefully it looks. Measured over 91 documents: 53 carry
#: pictures and 18 pages are content that ``text`` cannot see at all.
#:
#: The recognised text is *appended* rather than substituted, because those
#: pages usually do have a heading in real text above the picture, and
#: replacing it would trade one loss for another.
MODES = ("text", "image")

#: How little text makes a page "a picture with a caption" rather than "a page".
#: Set from what the corpus actually contains: the uniform-regulation pages
#: carry 120–160 characters of heading above a full-page illustration, and a
#: threshold of 40 — which is where the OCR route starts — called every one of
#: them a normal page.
